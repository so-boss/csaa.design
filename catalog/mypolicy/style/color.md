### Colors inherit from two tiers: **brand** & **product**.

The brand-level colors define the primary, neutral, & extended color palettes. The product-level color system matches the tone of the product in accordance with the requirements and function of the color.

## Primaries / Brand Color
Brand color is one of the most intuitive visual elements that is used to embody product characteristics and communicate ideas. When selecting colors, it is important to understand how the brand color is used in the user interface.

```color-palette
colors:
   - {name: "01 / BLUE", value: "#00338D"}
   - {name: "02 / BLUE", value: "#0096D6"}
   - {name: "03 / BLUE", value: "#88CBDF"}
   - {name: "01 / YELLOW", value: "#FFC425"}
   - {name: "01 / RED", value: "#D52B1E"}
```

## Functional Colors
Functional color represents a clear message as well as status, such as success, error, failure, reminder, link and so on. Functional color selection need to comply with the user's basic understanding of color.

We suggest that the functional colors should be kept as consistent as possible under a set of product systems. Do not have too much customization to interfere with the user's experience.
