### Colors inherit from two tiers: **brand** & **product**.

The CSAA brand colors retain the AAA color scheme, but are updated to include a few more shades, creating a more modern & diverse color palette.

## Primaries / Brand Color
Brand color is one of the most intuitive visual elements that is used to embody product characteristics and communicate ideas. When selecting colors, it is important to understand how the brand color is used in the user interface.

```color-palette

   - {name: "01 / BLUE", value: "#00338D"}
   - {name: "02 / BLUE", value: "#0096D6"}
   - {name: "01 / RED", value: "#D52B1E"}
```

## Neutral Colors
Mainly used in a large part of the text interface, in addition to the background, borders, dividing lines, and other scenes are also very common. Neutral color definition needs to consider the difference between dark background and light background, while incorporating the WCAG 2.0 standard.
