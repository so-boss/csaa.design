Our Digital Servies Design Style Guide offers and array of colors, iconography, typography, and other interface elements that are used across all our products.

The Design Ecosystem was created with a few key principles in mind: consistency, guidance, and resemblance.
### Consistency
This is a primary tenet of our design philosophy. A consistent user experience reduces the amount of learning our customers need to do, which allows them to quickly and easily find information and complete their tasks.

### Guidance
The elements of the Design Ecosystem were also intended to guide the customer, especially first time users. Let users know what to expect by giving visual cues such as hints, tips, and showing progress.

### Resemblance
Creating  resemblance in elements can create a better user experience. If effort is put into making things resemble each other, it is noticed and understood unconsciously as intentional, inspiring confidence in the thoughtfulness and craft of the design. It imbues a sense of professionalism and quality, while keeping the user's journey seamless.
