Our icons adhere to the following two principles and are designed for cross-platform consistency:\n1. Graphics that are clear, intuitive, and simple enjoy a higher degree of recognition and are more easily understood\n2. All icons in the user interface should be consistent in style (detail design, perspective, stroke weight, etc.)\n\n## Key Contour Lines#\nContour lines play an important role in making various icons with the same visual effect.\n\nPlease make all icons in the 1024\xd71024 resolution (16\xd716 64 times). \n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 2\nsrc: "/styleguide/contourlines.png"\n```\n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 2\nsrc: "/styleguide/contourplus.png"\n```\n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 2\nsrc: "/styleguide/contourx.png"\n```\n\n## Stroke Weight\n\n```hint|span-2,neutral\nConsistent stroke weight is the key to maintaining the visual unity of the entire icon system. \n```\n```image\nspan: 2\nplain: true\nsrc: "/styleguide/stroke-correct.png"\ntitle: "Correct"\ndescription: |\n    Line thickness is consistently 72px\n```\n\n```image\nspan: 2\nplain: true\nsrc: "/styleguide/stroke-incorrect.png"\ntitle: "Incorrect"\ndescription: |\n    Line thickness is not uniform\n\n```\n\n## Naming Conventions\nUniform naming conventions make finding icons faster and easier. For example, icons with a surrounding outline have a uniform "-o" suffix.\n\n## Sizing\nIcons should be scaled according to the text size.\n\nFor example, icons inline with 18px font should be 18px square with 8px of spacing.\n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 6\nsrc: "/styleguide/iconsizing.png"\n```\n\n## Color\nThe color of the icon should be consistent the color of the surrounding copy, unless the icon is being used to express state (in which case it should be colored accordingly).\n'}});
