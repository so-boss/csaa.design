We strongly recommend it since it has become an industry standard. The font system for a visual system is composed, mainly of:\n1. Family\n2. Base Font Size\n3. Scale & Line Height\n4. Weight\n5. Color\n\n## Font Size\nAAA\u2019s standard web font is Helvetica Bold and Regular faces. Large bold type should be used to establish clear information hierarchy. Substantial body copy should not use a size smaller than 14px.\n\nOur **base font size is 14px** to ensure the best user reading efficiency on most common monitors based on display screen reading distance (50 cm) and optimal reading angle (0.3).\n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 6\nsrc: "/styleguide/mypolicy/screenreading.png"\n```\n\n```type\n{\n  "font": "\'Helvetica\', sans-serif",\n  "color": "#333333",\n  "headings": [\n    { "label": "XL / LARGEST", "value": 60 },\n    { "label": "L / LARGE", "value": 36 },\n    { "label": "M / MEDIUM", "value": 24 },\n    { "label": "S / SMALL", "value": 18 },\n    { "label": "XS / EXTRA SMALL", "value": 14 },\n    { "label": "XXS / SMALLEST", "value": 12 },\n  ],\n  "paragraphs": [\n    {\n        "label": "Default Body Content",\n        "value": "14/22",\n        "font": "\'Helvetica\', sans-serif",\n    },\n    {\n        "label": "Small Body Content",\n        "value": "12/18",\n        "font": "\'Helvetica\', sans-serif",\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Line Height / Scale\nThe font scale and line height determine the beauty of the dynamics and order of a font system. Font scale refers to a series of font with different sizes. Line height can be understood as an invisible box wrapped outside the font.\n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 6\nsrc: "/styleguide/mypolicy/fontscale.png"\n```\n```table\nspan: 3\ncolumns:\n    - Size\n    - Font Size\n    - Line Height\nrows:\n  - Size: \'XXS\'\n    Font Size: 12px\n    Line Height: 18.00px\n  - Size: \'XS\'\n    Font Size: 14px\n    Line Height: 22.00px\n  - Size: \'S\'\n    Font Size: 18px\n    Line Height: 22.00px\n  - Size: \'M\'\n    Font Size: 24px\n    Line Height: 22.00px\n  - Size: \'L\'\n    Font Size: 36px\n    Line Height: 36.00px\n  - Size: \'XL\'\n    Font Size: 60px\n    Line Height: 55.00px\n```\n```hint|span-3,hint\nOur recommended **base font size is 14px**, and its corresponding **line height is 22.00px**.\n```\n\n## Weight\nThe choice of font weight is also based on the principles of order, stability, and restraint. In most cases, **regular**, **medium**, & **bold** should be adequate.\n```table\nspan: 3\ncolumns:\n    - Name\n    - Weight\nrows:\n  - Name: "Regular"\n    Weight: 400\n  - Name: \'Medium\'\n    Weight: 500\n  - Name: \'Bold\'\n    Weight: 600\n```\n\n## Color\nText will be difficult to read if it is too close to the background color. To achieve barrier-free design, we follow the WCAG standard, which maintains an AAA level of contrast ratio, i.e. 7:1 or more between body text, title, and background color.\n```image\nplain: true\nspan: 6\nsrc: "/styleguide/contrastfont.png"\n```\n'}});
