The notion of communicating ideas without the need for verbal or textual assistance is the core of iconography and the CSAA Digital Team achieves this through the use of grids, basic geometric shapes, consistency in stroke weights, recurring visual patterns, consistent angular patterns, predetermined radial curves, as well as many other rules and design fundamentals. The result is a simple, yet effective suite of icons that show direct relation to one another while distinctly communicating their specific ideas.
