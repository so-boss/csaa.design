### An icon is a symbol; a visual representation.

Icons can express actions, state, and even to categorize data. Our icons adhere to the following two principles and are designed for cross-platform consistency:
1. Graphics that are clear, intuitive, and simple enjoy a higher degree of recognition and are more easily understood
2. All icons in the user interface should be consistent in style (detail design, perspective, stroke weight, etc.)

## Key Contour Lines#
Contour lines play an important role in making various icons with the same visual effect.

Please make all icons in the 1024×1024 resolution (16×16 64 times).

```
```image

```

## Stroke Weight

```hint|span-2,neutral
Consistent stroke weight is the key to maintaining the visual unity of the entire icon system. 
```
```image
span: 2
plain: true
src: "/styleguide/stroke-correct.png"
title: "Correct"
description: |
    Line thickness is consistently 72px
```

```image
span: 2
plain: true
src: "/styleguide/stroke-incorrect.png"
title: "Incorrect"
description: |
    Line thickness is not uniform

```

## Naming Conventions
Uniform naming conventions make finding icons faster and easier. For example, icons with a surrounding outline have a uniform "-o" suffix.

## Sizing
Icons should be scaled according to the text size.

For example, icons inline with 18px font should be 18px square with 8px of spacing.
```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "/styleguide/iconsizing.png"
```

## Color
The color of the icon should be consistent the color of the surrounding copy, unless the icon is being used to express state (in which case it should be colored accordingly).
